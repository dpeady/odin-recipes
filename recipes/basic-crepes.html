    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li >
            In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water,
            sitting to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.
        </li> 
        <br>
        <li>
            Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the
            batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with
            a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.
        </li>

            Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.
