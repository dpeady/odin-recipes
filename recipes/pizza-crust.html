    <h1>Quick and Easy Pizza Crust</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go!
        It yields a soft, chewy crust. For a real treat, it is reccommended you use bread flour and bake it on a pizza stone, but if you don't have any
        bread flour lying aboutm all-purpose flour works well too. Enjoy!
